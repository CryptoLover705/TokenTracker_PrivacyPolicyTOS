### `invite` Command

#### Description:
This command replies with an invite link that allows the user to invite the bot to their own server.

#### Command Flow:

1. **Retrieve Bot's Client ID:**
   - The bot fetches its client ID from the `.env` file (`CLIENT_ID`). Ensure that the bot's `CLIENT_ID` is stored in the `.env` file for the command to work properly.

2. **Generate Invite Link:**
   - The invite link is dynamically constructed using the bot's client ID. The link grants the bot specific permissions (in this case, `689879510080`) and scope (`bot` and `applications.commands`) to allow the bot to function fully in other servers.

3. **Send Response:**
   - The bot sends a message with the invite link using the `interaction.reply` method. The message is not ephemeral (visible to everyone in the channel).
   
4. **Error Handling:**
   - If any error occurs during the execution of the command, the bot catches it and replies with a generic error message.

#### Example Response:

When a user invokes the `/invite` command, the bot will reply with:

```
You can invite me to your server using this link:
https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=YOUR_BOT_CLIENT_ID&permissions=689879510080&scope=bot%20applications.commands
```
